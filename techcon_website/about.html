            Arm's flagship developer event began in 2004 as DevCon, a modest
            gathering at the Santa Clara Convention Center dedicated to uniting
            processor experts, software developers, and hardware architects
            around ARM-based system innovation. By 2008, the conference had
            rebranded to Arm TechCon, evolving into a three-day flagship event
            highlighting embedded design, IoT proliferation, cloud-edge
            integration, and cutting-edge compute topics like AI and 5G. It
            served as the platform for major ARM milestones—keynotes such as
            Simon Segars “Fifth Wave” vision, the introduction of Total Compute
            architecture, and initiatives like Project Cassini and SystemReady.
            Following the disruptions of 2020-2022, TechCon transformed into Arm
            DevSummit, adopting an online format and exploring a broader
            developer ecosystem, from software tools to security layers.

            Running in parallel yet distinct, the SRC TECHCON, organized by the
            Semiconductor Research Corporation since at least 1990, is an annual
            hub in Austin where academia and industry converge to showcase
            semiconductor research breakthroughs. From early work on graphene
            nanoribbons and TCAD simulation tools to recent student-led poster
            sessions and technical awards, SRC TECHCON has nurtured
            university-driven innovation and engineer recruitment. The 2024
            edition featured over 200 research scholars, with nearly half women
            or under-represented minorities, and emphasized collaboration among
            top semiconductor firms, academic institutions, and future engineers
